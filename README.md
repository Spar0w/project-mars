# Project Mars

## What is it?

Project Mars is a modular, open source, Windows threat emulation platform written in C#. Project Mars runs on a plugin system that allows the user to mix and match different activities to build the threat that they want/need. It also allows plugins to be written quite easily and quickly for use with the platform. 

## What's the purpose?

The purpose of Project Mars is to provide a simple and robust platform to emulate any threat that the user can imagine. With the customization that comes from the playbook and plugin system, any threat can be emulated, tuned to the needs of the user. 

## How can I use it?

In its current state, the server and client are required to be run on Windows 10+ with dotnet 6.X installed. The only third party library used is [Sprectre Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) which is used in on the server for its UI and menu.
